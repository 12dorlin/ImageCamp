% DNMP task compare mean frames

%% 0 - Get frames to include for each trial type/direction


%% 0.1 - Identify epochs for each trial type/direction

%% 1 - Calculate Mean Frame for R/L Forced Trials, and for odd and even forced trials
% For loop through through each epoch, concatenate frames along dim 3,
% write subfunction for this

%% 2 - Calculate Mean Frame for R/L Free Trials , and for odd and even free trials

%% 3 - Calculate correlation between 1 and 2, and within 1/2 odd v even
